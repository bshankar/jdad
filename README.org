* JDAD
An extremely tiny JSON parser written in Js to learn how recursive
descent parsing works. The [[https://github.com/bshankar/jdad/blob/master/src/parse.js][parser]]'s design is inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)][Monads]] and
is just 32 SLOC!

** Usage
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # Parsing a file
   node src/index.js test/twitter.json

   # Benchmark against JSON.parse
   node src/index.js test/twitter.json bench
   #+END_SRC

** Limitations
   - Extremely slow! 50-100 times slower than =JSON.parse=.
   - Does not show where a syntax error occurred. It just returns =null=
     when an invalid JSON is encountered.
   - Does not convert Unicode escape sequences to Unicode.
